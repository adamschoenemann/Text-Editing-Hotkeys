Text-Editing-Hotkeys
====================

My AutoHotkey shortcuts for fast text-editing.
I tried Vim a couple of times, and while I like the ideology, it can be a hassle to set up, and its idiosyncrasy is a problem for me, because I like to switch editors/IDE as I explore new languages and frameworks. Instead, I created custom hotkeys using AutoHotkey for fast home-row editing, and a slew of other shortcuts to improve my work-efficiency - across all IDEs! There's a bunch of stuff in there that is experimental, and that I switch off and on at different times, and some things are shamelessly copy-pasted from other people's good ideas, so kudos where appropriate.
